## Online-Shoppers-Purchase-Intention
A machine learning project to predict likelihood of a transaction to be completed.

### Description
The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions. The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period. Of the 12,330 sessions in the dataset, 84.5% (10,422) were negative class samples that did not end with shopping, and the rest (1908) were positive class samples ending with shopping.

### Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to design a machine learning classification system, that is able to predict an online shopper's intention ( buy or no buy ), based on the values of the given features (from google analytics). A number of different classification algorithms is tested, in order to pick the best one for the project.
